# Grooming Card Interface

## CSC 365 SP 2021 Group Project

_Developers: Jackie Morrison & Robert Stonner_

## Startup Instructions

- Must have JDK 11.
- Must have PostgreSQL installed (I use 12).
- Must have role 'postgres' with password 'password' (can be changed in application.properties).
- Must have database 'postgres' running on localhost:5432 (a lot of these are PostgreSQL defaults, so this shouldn't be difficultto set up except for the password change).
- Currently, just use `./gradlew bootRun` within the project directory.
- Runs on `localhost:8080`. Try `localhost:8080/demo/` and `localhost:8080/demo/object/` to test basic functionality.
